### Design Process

***Wireframes***

- Initial Wireframe designs were used to plan out the layout for the Company List and Company Detail pages

***Models***

- The next step was to plan and devise an ERD for each of my database models and a schema to map out and understand the relationships between them. I created an ERD and model schema for the project based on all of the elements that I would like to include if I was able (this included the Should Have and Could Have User Story issues).

  - User Model (Automatically created in Django framework)
  - Profile Model
  - Company Model
  - Comments Model

  - Favourite Model

## Testing

### Automated Testing

Each resource in the API has been tested using the REST built-in APITestCase functionality. Tests are written in a tests.py file within each app directory. 

Each test is manually checked by forcing a controlled fail by using an incorrect status code and ensuring that this is the only reason the test fails. The status code is then updated and the test run again to ensure it passes with the expected status code.
